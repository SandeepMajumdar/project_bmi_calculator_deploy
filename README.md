# project_bmi_calculator_deploy
Developing a BMI calculator using python, web development using pywebio, and deployment on Heroku
Picked up this python based web framework two days back, and it feels this is the way to go for ML app demos
This project has been deployed on Heroku at the link: https://bmi-calculator-pywebio.herokuapp.com/
Feel free to fork, download, clone, reproduce, etc
It is inspired by work done by Wang
